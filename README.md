STORY
You are a ship captain's engineer and both of you are going on a trip to Mars for resource collection. However, on your way the ship suffered a fatal malfunction and crashed into the moon. You were knocked unconscious and were saved by your captain as thankfully there is an abandoned moon base. The captain is suffering mortal wounds and is physcially incapacitated.
As you wake up, you acknowledge the situation and are instructed by your captain and the NPCs of the base to find medical supplies(1), Extract energy to power the ship(2), find materials to repair the ship(3), and find tools to repair the ship(4). 

In the first part of the quest, the player needs to find ship parts that are in the form of gears and a wrench. The player will then need to find medical supplies. Once done, the player will proceed to the mines and using the extractor gun that was given to them, they need to extract the necessary materials from gems that are scattered throughout the mine. To extract, the player needs to press "E" five times until the meter at the bottom of the screen is full. 
Once completed, the player will have to proceed to the mine exit, teleporting to the base exterior where the ship was located. The game will be completed at that point.
